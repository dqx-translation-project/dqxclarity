# dqxclarity

A translation utility for the game "Dragon Quest X".

See the [wiki](https://dqx-translation-project.github.io/dqxclarity.html) for how to get started!

## About

Hello, I'm Serany (Discord: @mebo, Github: @jmctune) and wrote `dqxclarity`. I've worked on this project since about April 2021~ and have used it as a learning experience to pick up Python, learn a bit of reverse engineering and remote process memory editing. I've put a lot of time into this project and will continue to actively develop and maintain it as long as I have an interest in Dragon Quest X (or if this game ever gets a western localization).

This includes `dqxclarity` (this repository), the modded translation DAT you see published in the releases and other tooling as part of this Github org (`dqx-translation-project`).

I appreciate the support and contributions from others that have committed to this project:

- @xshobux
- @SuperFirm84
- @Sevithian (built the initial launcher)

## Support

## Disclaimer

**I forfeit any responsibility if you receive a warning, a ban or a stern talking to while using this program. `dqxclarity` alters process memory, but only for the intent of allowing English-speaking players to read the game in their language. No malicious activities are being performed with `dqxclarity`. The goal of this program is simply to translate the game for non-Japanese speaking players to enjoy.**
