 1. Do whatever you like with the original work (except for what's outlined here), just don't be a dick.

     Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

	 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
	 1b. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.
	 1c. Redistributing the code in this repository with the intention of profiting from it (donations or
	 	 otherwise). This makes you a SUPER dick and you should feel terrible.

 2. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes
 you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back.
